(Freeport LNG) today announced that the third of the company's three LNG storage tanks has been returned to service with the approval of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Total net revenues in the first quarter of 2025 were RMB2,699.9 million (US$372.1 million), representing an increase of 19.0% from RMB2,268.7 million in the same period of 2024, primarily attributable to an increase in revenues from freight matching services. Freight matching services. Revenues from freight matching services in the first quarter of 2025 were RMB2,247.1 million (US$309.7 million), representing an increase of 20.2% from RMB1,869.7 million in the same period of 2024. The increase was mainly due to the rapid increase in transaction service. Freight brokerage service. Revenues from freight brokerage service in the first quarter of 2025 were RMB965.7 million (US$133.1 million), remaining nearly flat compared with RMB965.2 million in the same period of 2024, primarily attributable to an increase in service fee rate, offset by a decrease in transaction volume. Freight listing service. Revenues from freight listing service in the first quarter of 2025 were RMB234.9 million (US$32.4 million), an increase of 10.0% from RMB213.5 million in the same period of 2024, primarily due to the growing number of total paying members. Transaction service. Revenues from transaction service amounted to RMB1,046.5 million (US$144.2 million) in the first quarter of 2025, an increase of 51.5% from RMB691.0 million in the same period of 2024, primarily driven by increases in order volume, penetration rate, and per-order transaction service fee. Value-added services.4 Revenues from value-added services in the first quarter of 2025 were RMB452.8 million (US$62.4 million), an increase of 13.5% from RMB399.0 million in the same period of 2024. The increase was primarily due to growing demand for credit solutions. Cost of Revenues (including VAT net of government grants of RMB795.2 million and RMB466.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2025, respectively). Cost of revenues in the first quarter of 2025 was RMB698.6 million (US$96.3 million), a decrease of 32.3% from RMB1,031.9 million in the same period of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in VAT, related tax surcharges and other tax costs, net of grants from government authorities. These tax-related costs net of government grants totaled RMB565.6 million, representing a decrease of 37.7% from RMB908.0 million in the same period of 2024, primarily due to a decrease in tax costs net of government grants related to the Company's freight brokerage service. Sales and Marketing Expenses. Sales and marketing expenses in the first quarter of 2025 were RMB377.9 million (US$52.1 million), compared with RMB340.1 million in the same period of 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising and marketing expenses for user acquisitions, partially offset by lower salary and benefits expenses. General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2025 were RMB186.0 million (US$25.6 million), compared with RMB264.5 million in the same period of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to lower share-based compensation and salary and benefits expenses. Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses in the first quarter of 2025 were RMB193.4 million (US$26.6 million), compared with RMB247.7 million in the same period of 2024.

The total non-performing loan ratio8 for these loans was 2.2% as of March 31, 2025, compared with 2.2% as of December 31, 2024. In the first quarter of 2025, net cash provided by operating activities was RMB325.6 million (US$44.9 million). 4The Company provides a range of value-added services including credit solutions, insurance services, electronic toll collection, energy services and other services on the FTA platform. 5 Non-GAAP adjusted operating income is defined as income from operations excluding (i) share-based compensation expense; (ii) amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions; and (iii) compensation cost incurred in relation to acquisitions. See ""Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" and ""Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results"" at the end of this press release. 6 ADS refers to American depositary shares, each of which represents 20 Class A ordinary shares. 7 Non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net income per ADS is net income attributable to ordinary shareholders excluding (i) share-based compensation expense; (ii) amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions; (iii) compensation cost incurred in relation to acquisitions; (iv) impairment loss of long-term investment; and (v) tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments, divided by weighted average number of basic and diluted ADSs, respectively. For more information, refer to ""Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" and ""Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results"" at the end of this press release. 8 Non-performing loan ratio is calculated by dividing the outstanding principal and all accrued and unpaid interests of the on-balance sheet loans that were over 90 calendar days past due (excluding loans that are over 180 days past due and are therefore charged off) by the total outstanding principal and all accrued and unpaid interests of the on-balance sheet loans (excluding loans that are over 180 days past due and are therefore charged off) reduced by an allowance for estimated losses as of a specified date. Business Outlook The Company expects its total net revenues to be between RMB3.06 billion and RMB3.12 billion for the second quarter of 2025, representing a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 10.6% to 12.9%. These forecasts reflect the Company's current and preliminary views on the market and operational conditions, which are subject to change and cannot be predicted with reasonable accuracy as of the date hereof. Further Investments In Plus PRC Holding Ltd (""Plus PRC"") On May 16, 2025, the board of directors of the Company (the ""Board"") approved that the Company may make additional investment of US$125 million in the preferred shares of Plus PRC. The US$125 million will count in the principal and accrued interest of certain convertible notes issued by Plus PRC and purchased by the Company in May 2024 and January 2025 (the ""Convertible Notes"") as the Company intends to convert the principal and accrued interest of such Convertible Notes into preferred shares of Plus PRC. Certain other investors, including Mr. Peter Hui Zhang, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, intend to make concurrent investments in Plus PRC on substantially the same terms as the Company. While the exact investment amounts of the other investors are subject to adjustment, the Company expects to hold no less than 52.8% equity interest and 56.2% voting rights in Plus PRC (excluding any shares reserved for future issuance under the share incentive plan of Plus PRC) upon completion of these investment transactions, and with expected amendment to the memorandum and articles of association of Plus PRC that will allow the Company to control the board of Plus PRC, the Company expects to consolidate the financial results of Plus PRC into its consolidated financial statements upon completion of these investment transactions. A definitive agreement has not yet been entered into for these investment transactions. There is no guarantee that a definitive agreement will be signed or that these investment transactions will be completed. Share Repurchases The Company repurchased a total of 60,728,727 ordinary shares from certain executive officers of the Company for an aggregate consideration of US$37,499,988.92 in privately negotiated transactions on May 19, 2025. The repurchased shares correspond to part of the vested share-based awards previously granted to these executive officers. The repurchase price was set at US$0.6175 per ordinary share, which was determined by dividing US$12.35, the closing price of the Company's ADSs on May 16, 2025, by 20, which is the ratio of the Company's Class A ordinary shares to ADSs. The Company intends to cancel all of the repurchased shares in accordance with applicable rules and regulations. The above share repurchases were conducted pursuant to resolutions of the Board, which authorized the Company to repurchase ordinary shares corresponding to vested share-based awards granted under the Company's share incentive plans. Such repurchases were not conducted, and therefore will not reduce the amount of ADSs and/or ordinary shares that the Company may repurchase, under its existing share repurchase program as previously announced by the Company. Such repurchases were intended to enable the executive officers to realize the benefits from some of their vested share-based awards through privately negotiated transactions as opposed to reselling such shares in the open market. Among these executive officers, Mr. Peter Hui Zhang has committed to using all net proceeds from the Company's repurchase of his vested shares for his investment in the preferred shares of Plus PRC. The repurchases were funded from the Company's existing cash reserves. Senior Management Changes The Company announced that Mr. Simon Chong Cai was appointed as the Chief Financing and Investment Officer of the Company in charge of financing, investment and investor relations and ceased to be the Chief Financial Officer of the Company effective May 21, 2025. Additionally, Mr. Langbo Guo, the Company's President, has expanded his responsibilities to include financial, tax, and cash planning and management, in addition to his existing duties related to strategic planning and operational analysis. Effective May 21, 2025, Mr. Guo will also serve as the principal financial and accounting officer of the Company.

May 21, 2025, 05:50 ET Share this article Share toX Share this article Share toX Plug-and-play solution eliminates printer driver dependencies, streamlines user management, and enhances operational flexibility PORTSMOUTH, N.H., May 21, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Loftware, the global leader in Enterprise Labeling and Artwork Management solutions, and SATO Corporation, a pioneer in the development of auto-ID and labeling solutions, today announced the availability of their cloud-connected label printing solution for AEP-equipped SATO printers1. This comes at a time when the adoption of cloud-based technologies is on the rise, with the Loftware/SATO partnership supporting this shift to streamline business processes and enhance supply chain agility. The joint solution, which connects Loftware Cloud with SATO's cloud-connected printers, eliminates printer driver dependencies, allowing IT teams to avoid installation, troubleshooting, updates, and management. This significantly reduces maintenance and support costs, while enabling businesses to print from any PC browser, providing flexibility to scale or adapt operations without technical constraints. Additionally, users can access the latest approved label templates from anywhere, at any time, through a secure browser and seamlessly print from their SATO printer. The platform also streamlines user management, enabling administrators to quickly add and approve new users in minutes without the need for license keys, reducing administrative burden and improving operational efficiency. The Loftware/SATO partnership supports a range of industry applications. This includes supplier compliance to ensure accurate, timely labeling and RFID tagging - eliminating relabeling and improving supply chain efficiency. It also enhances in-plant labeling for better process control within factories, ensures retail labeling consistency with industry standards, and streamlines third-party logistics (3PL) labeling for seamless integration with logistics providers. Hayato Shindo, Group Business Officer at SATO Corporation, commented: ""In today's fast-paced business environment, manufacturers face many challenges, such as changing customer, legal and regulatory requirements; remote working and collaboration; rapid scaling up of operations; and improving productivity while reducing operating costs. Traditional desktop label design applications, while effective in the past, are no longer sufficient to manage these complexities. The solution provided by SATO and Loftware addresses these challenges head-on by offering a centralized and secure platform for label design and printing."" Loftware Cloud expands labeling capabilities across internal stakeholders, external suppliers, co-manufacturers, and co-packers, who all play a role in the complex supply chain process. With seamless integration into both on-premise and cloud-based business applications such as ERP, WMS, and PLM, Loftware Cloud optimizes workflows for greater efficiency and accuracy. SATO's cloud-connected printers further enhance this solution with effortless installation and mobility. Simply connecting a LAN cable ensures the printer is ready for immediate use. This plug-and-play functionality makes it easy to relocate printers as needed, giving businesses the flexibility to adapt to changing operational demands. Denis Stojanoski, Loftware Senior Alliance Program Manager, added: ""Loftware and SATO have a long-standing partnership built on a shared commitment to innovation. Together, we continue to develop cutting-edge supply chain solutions that empower businesses to operate more efficiently, adapt to evolving industry demands, and future-proof their operations. By combining our expertise, we're driving the future of labeling to deliver greater agility, scalability, and value for our customers."" Loftware and SATO's global partnership extends over a quarter century. In recent years, the two have developed an advanced RFID encoding and logging solution to help businesses meet stringent traceability standards.

Overview of Vienna Consolidation serviceThis service covers transport from major ports in Japan (Tokyo, Yokohama, Nagoya, Kobe, Hakata and Moji) to a total of 26 destinations in Central and Eastern Europe (Vienna, Graz, Linz, Innsbruck, Zagreb, Prague, Budapest, etc.). Nippon Express uses FP1, which sails non-stop from Japan to Northern Europe, for containerized cargo transport to the Vienna CFS, where the containers are offloaded and the cargo devanned and transported to its respective destinations. The NX Group handles the cargo from origin to destination, ensuring high-quality, safe, and reliable service. Features of the service- A wide variety of destinationsService to the entire Central and Eastern European regions is available from the Vienna CFS. Nippon Express provides extensive first-rate services using the trunk-line transport offered by cargo-partner's numerous business locations throughout the regions. - High transport qualityContainerized cargo is shipped directly from Japan to Northern Europe and then transported to the Vienna CFS. NX Group business locations perform all CFS tasks at both origin and destination to maintain high transport quality. - Attractive pricingCustomers can save an average of 20-30% compared to traditional service pricing.

(""Flex LNG"" or the ""Company"") today announced its unaudited financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2025. Highlights: Vessel operating revenues of $88.4 million for the first quarter 2025, compared to $90.9 million for the fourth quarter 2024. Net income of $18.7 million and basic earnings per share of $0.35 for the first quarter 2025, compared to net income of $45.2 million and basic earnings per share of $0.84 for the fourth quarter 2024. Average Time Charter Equivalent (""TCE"") rate of $73,891 per day for the first quarter 2025, compared to $75,319 per day for the fourth quarter 2024. Adjusted EBITDA of $65.6 million for the first quarter 2025, compared to $68.7 million for the fourth quarter 2024. Adjusted net income of $29.4 million for the first quarter 2025, compared to $30.8 million for the fourth quarter 2024. Adjusted basic earnings per share of $0.54 for the first quarter 2025, compared to $0.57 for the fourth quarter 2024. In March 2025, Flex Constellation was re-delivered from the existing time charter contract and was employed in the short-term market, until the commencement of a 15-year time charter contract during the first or second quarter of 2026. In April 2025, the charterer of Flex Artemis elected not to exercise the option under the time charter. The vessel is expected to be re-delivered from the original 5-year variable hire contract in the third quarter of 2025. Following the re-delivery, Flex Artemis will perform her scheduled dry-docking and subsequently will be marketed for short and long-term contracts. In May 2025, we received a credit approved term sheet for a $175.0 million, 10-year sale and leaseback with an Asian-based lease provider for Flex Courageous. The refinancing will repay the outstanding amount relevant to Flex Courageous, under the $330 Million Sale and Leaseback. In May 2025, the Company announces that it has initiated the process of refinancing the vessels Flex Resolute and Flex Constellation, aiming to free up liquidity, reduce the cost of debt and extend the debt maturities. The Company aims to secure commitments and conclude the new financings during the second half of 2025 In May 2025, at the 2025 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), the Company's shareholders approved the delisting of the Company's common shares from the Oslo Stock Exchange (OSE) and authorised the Board of Directors to take steps to implement the delisting including filing an application to the OSE on behalf of the Company. In May 2025, the Company published its ESG report for 2024, its seventh comprehensive and stand-alone sustainability report, which provides an opportunity to reflect on the Company's ESG journey thus far. The Company declared a dividend for the first quarter 2025 of $0.75 per share. The dividend is payable on or about June 20, 2025 to shareholders, on record as of June 6, 2025. Marius Foss, Interim CEO of Flex LNG Management AS, commented: ""Flex LNG delivered solid results for the first quarter, with revenues of $88.4 million, or $86.8 million excluding EUAs. Net income came in at $18.7 million, translating to earnings per share (EPS) of $0.35 and adjusted net income came in at $29.4 million, or $0.54 per share. As expected, revenue decreased by $3 million compared to Q4 2024 primarily due to lower earnings from Flex Artemis, operating on a variable index hire. Additionally, Flex Constellation was redelivered at the end of February and commenced a new spot voyage in late March. Flex Constellation is expected to remain in the spot market until she begins a 15-year time charter in H1 2026. Flex Artemis has been on a 5-year Time Charter and will be redelivered in Q3-2025, after which she will undergo her 5-year special survey drydocking. With her full reliquefaction system, she is highly attractive for charterers on long-term Time Charters. Late last year, we strengthened our earnings foundation by securing up to 37 years of new contract backlog for Flex Constellation, Flex Courageous and Flex Resolute. As a result, our total minimum firm backlog now stands at 59 years, with the potential to expand to 88 years through charterers' extension options. This provides strong earnings visibility going forward. Following these contract additions we see opportunities for attractive refinancings. Today we announce that we have received a credit approved term sheet for a $175m sale and leaseback at very attractive terms for the refinancing of Flex Courageous. We also announce that we have initiated the process of refinancing the Flex Resolute and Flex Constellation, aiming to free up liquidity, reduce cost of debt and extend debt maturities. We see increasing momentum in the US LNG sector, evidenced by Woodside's FID on the Louisiana LNG project. This positive news flow signals a wave of upcoming liquefaction capacity. These new projects are expected to come on stream just as some of our vessels conclude their existing charters, creating an ideal opportunity to re-contract. Today, we are pleased to release our 2024 ESG Report — the seventh edition since our inaugural report in 2018. We are proud to report a Lost Time Injury Frequency (LTIF) of zero, which is a testament to our relentless focus on health and safety. We encourage readers to explore the report to understand our continuous commitment to sustainability. With solid earnings, substantial backlog and our strong balance sheet with $410 million of cash and no debt maturities prior to 2028, the Board is pleased to announce another quarterly dividend per share of $0.75. This is equal to a quarterly dividend pay-out of approximately $41 million. Therefore, we have paid trailing twelve months dividends of $3.0 per share, giving our investors a running yield of about 12 per cent. This is our fifteenth ordinary quarterly dividend of $0.75, and when adding the special dividends we will have paid out approximately $650 million since Q4-2021.""

Forward-Looking Statements Matters discussed in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides safe harbor protections for forward-looking statements in order to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their business. Forward-looking statements include statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance, and underlying assumptions and other statements, which are other than statements of historical facts. The Company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and is including this cautionary statement in connection with this safe harbor legislation. The words ""believe,"" ""expect,"" ""forecast,"" ""anticipate,"" ""aim,"" ""commit,"" ""estimate,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""possible,"" ""potential,"" ""pending,"" ""target,"" ""project,"" ""likely,"" ""may,"" ""will,"" ""would,"" ""should,"" ""could"" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this press release are based upon various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions, including without limitation, management's examination of historical operating trends, data contained in the Company's records and other data available from third parties. Although management believes that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because these assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond the Company's control, there can be no assurance that the Company will achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or projections.

Retail volume increased by 46% year over year for the quarter as we penetrated deeper into reverse logistics, and we continued to work closely with various e-commerce platform and enterprise customers to develop differentiated products and services which include time-definite delivery and customized KA consumer services."" Mr. Lai added, ""We believe competition in China's express delivery industry has reached the ""white-hot"" stage, and it is further exacerbated by a greater portion of volume being either low value or loss-making for the logistic service providers. Our approach to network policies has been on maintaining consistency and cultivating long-term stability. At times of fierce competition, we are learning to better leverage our existing competitive advantage and at the same time, stay focused on initiatives that can bring about long-term prospects of profitable growth."" Ms. Huiping Yan, Chief Financial Officer of ZTO, commented, ""ZTO's core express ASP decreased by 11 cents largely driven by 16 cents in higher volume incentives and 6 cents lower weight average per parcel partially offset by 12 cents increase in KA unit price. Combined unit sorting and transportation costs decreased 9 cents thanks to cost productivity gain initiatives. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 4.7%. Cash flow from operating activities was 2.4 billion, and capital spending was 2 billion."" Ms. Yan added, ""Volume, backed by high quality of services, remains our top priority. Healthier profitability by the ZTO brand and its network partners relative to our peers are built upon decades of interdependent and cooperative relationship founded on our ""shared success"" philosophy. Achieving a reasonable level of corporate earnings, and at the same time, laying the groundwork and support our franchise partners to maintain confidence in long-term prospects, to reengineer last mile delivery processes and hereby reduce costs, and to increase their couriers' share into retail profit, our concerted effort will forge new competitive advantage to expand ZTO's volume leadership.""

EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders and adjusted basic and diluted earnings per American depositary share attributable to ordinary shareholders should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to net income or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of the Company's operating performance.

EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders and adjusted basic and diluted earnings per American depositary share attributable to ordinary shareholders presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to ZTO's data.

The combination will enable both companies to expand scale, capture significant operational efficiencies, and offer an enhanced suite of services, including cross-selling opportunities and a more robust carrier network, positioning the combined company for even greater growth in the years ahead. Customers and carriers will experience the enhanced financial strength of the combined platform with Cambridge's backing. This combination marks a strategic milestone for Everest Transportation Systems, which has been redefining operational efficiency through its tech-enabled platform and unique ""owned and operated"" offshore labor model. By integrating Simple Logistics' specialized capabilities in refrigerated logistics, Everest will diversify its portfolio and continue to enhance capabilities for a broader client base. In August 2021, Cambridge completed a majority investment in Everest, a founder-owned freight brokerage. Everest specializes in full truckload, drayage, intermodal, hazmat, expedited and volume partials, with a focus on stable, non-cyclical industries such as food and beverage. Everest has achieved great success today in part because of level of automation, but also due to its unique ""owned and operated"" offshore labor force to reinforce its North America operations. In partnership with Everest's management team, Cambridge has executed multiple value creation initiatives. Cambridge completely re-platformed Everest to leverage leading cloud-based software applications and tools in an integrated fashion, optimizing both internal workflows and customer experience. Additionally, Cambridge recruited a leading Independent Board Chairman, Chris Pickett, who built Coyote Logistics from inception until a $1.8 billion exit to UPS. Simple Logistics is a well-established freight brokerage provider specializing in timely, efficient, complex, and service sensitive movement of refrigerated freight and dry van requirements for large customers. The Company is led by Steve Spoerl (CEO), who has decades of experience in truck leasing, food distribution, and supply chain, and Jim Caine (COO) and Jeff Paul (CFO), who will all be joining the Everest platform post-transaction. ""We are thrilled to welcome Simple Logistics to the Everest Transportation Systems family,"" said Jake Elperin, Co-Founder and CEO of Everest Transportation Systems. ""Steve and his team have built a strong reputation in the industry since 2012, and their expertise and network will be invaluable as we work together to serve a growing and diverse customer base,"" said Phil Weber, Co-Founder and COO of Everest Transportation Systems. Steve Spoerl, CEO of Simple Logistics, said, ""This combination represents a pivotal opportunity for Simple Logistics.

Mr. Song Wang, Chief Financial Officer of Dingdong, stated, ""In the first quarter of 2025, Dingdong reported a revenue of RMB5.48 billion, reflecting a 9.1% year-over-year increase and marking five consecutive quarters of positive growth. Non-GAAP net profit was RMB30.3 million, and GAAP net profit was RMB8.0 million, and operating net cash inflow reached RMB85 million. The Company continued to demonstrate positive profitability alongside positive operating net cash inflow. By the end of the first quarter, after accounting for short-term loans, our actual funds amounted to RMB2.89 billion, indicating a continued net increase. This year, we are committed to executing our ""narrow yet deep"" value proposition, intensifying our efforts to satisfy consumers through quality products and services, while establishing a unique path focused on quality, stability, and consistent supply capabilities."" First Quarter 2025 Financial Results Total revenues were RMB5,479.0 million (US$755.0 million) compared with total revenues of RMB5,024.0 million in the same quarter of 2024, primarily due to the rise of number of orders resulting from rise in the average monthly number of transacting users and higher monthly order frequency, and new opened frontline fulfillment stations with density and market penetration improved in East China. The increase was offset by suspension of operations for a number of stations in 2024, more outbound residents from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai during this Chinese New Year, and the impact of the decline in food CPI prices in the first quarter of 2025. Product Revenues were RMB5,386.5 million (US$742.3 million) compared with product revenues of RMB4,944.3 million in the same quarter of 2024. Service Revenues were RMB92.5 million (US$12.8 million) compared with service revenues of RMB79.8 million in the same quarter of 2024, primarily driven by the increase of customers subscribing to Dingdong's membership program, and more delivery fees collected with more orders in this quarter. Total operating costs and expenses were RMB5,519.0 million (US$760.5million) compared with RMB5,045.0 million in the same quarter of 2024, with a detailed breakdown as below: Cost of goods sold was RMB3,842.1 million (US$529.5 million), an increase of 10.1% from RMB3,488.7 million in the same quarter of 2024. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues increased slightly to 70.1% from 69.4% in the same quarter of 2024. Gross margin decreased to 29.9% from 30.6% in the same quarter of 2024. Fulfillment expenses were RMB1,256.1 million (US$173.1 million), an increase of 9.5% from RMB1,147.0 million in the same quarter of 2024. Fulfillment expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to 22.9% from 22.8% in the same quarter of 2024.

Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased slightly to 2.0% from 2.2% in the same quarter of 2024. General and administrative expenses were RMB112.9 million (US$15.6 million), an increase of 7.5% from RMB105.0 million in the same quarter of 2024, mainly due to the increase of staff cost. Product development expenses were RMB198.0 million (US$27.3 million), an increase of 2.4% from RMB193.3 million in the same quarter of 2024, primarily due to the increase of staff cost. While advocating for energy and resource saving, we will continue to invest in our product development capabilities, agricultural technology, data algorithms, and other technology infrastructure, to further enhance our competitiveness. Loss from operations was RMB21.2 million (US$2.9 million), compared with operating loss of RMB11.1 million in the same quarter of 2024. Non-GAAP income from operations, which is a non-GAAP measure for loss from operations that excludes share-based compensation expenses, was RMB1.1 million (US$0.2 million), decreased by 94.0% year over year, compared with Non-GAAP income from operations of RMB18.1 million in the same quarter of 2024. Net income was RMB8.0 million (US$1.1 million), compared with net income of RMB12.3 million in the same quarter of 2024. Non-GAAP net income, which is a non-GAAP measure that excludes share-based compensation expenses, was RMB30.3 million (US$4.2 million), decreased by 26.8% year over year, compared with non-GAAP net income of RMB41.5 million in the same quarter of 2024. In addition, non-GAAP net income margin, which is the Company's non-GAAP net income as a percentage of total revenues, was 0.6% compared with 0.8% in the same quarter of 2024. Basic and diluted net income per share were RMB0.02 (US$0.00), compared with net income per share of RMB0.03 in the same quarter of 2024. Non-GAAP net income per share, basic and diluted, was RMB0.09 (US$0.00), compared with RMB0.12 in the same quarter of 2024. Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments were RMB4,294.5 million (US$591.8 million) as of March 31, 2025, compared with RMB4,452.2 million as of December 31, 2024. We have been working diligently to optimize our capital usage and financing structure. The cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments deducting the balance of short-term borrowings, is RMB 2.9 billion, a net increase for the seventh consecutive quarter.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income margin, non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders and non-GAAP net income per share, basic and diluted, in evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in its business by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, which are non-cash charges and do not correlate to any operating activity trends. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about the Company's results of operations, enhance the overall understanding of the Company's past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company's management in its financial and operational decision-making. The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the Company's operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of operations and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company's definition of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from those of industry peers and may not be comparable with their non-GAAP financial measures. The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned ""Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results"" set forth at the end of this announcement.

The system is expected to generate approximately 892 megawatt-hours of low-carbon energy each year—a meaningful step in GEODIS' global effort to support more sustainable logistics. Continue Reading Executives at GEODIS, Prologis and Beetmann at the solar installation's commemorative ceremony in Tepotzotlán Estate of Mexico ""This solar installation is more than just a technological upgrade—it's a reflection of our ongoing commitment to innovation, responsibility and sustainability,"" said Jessica Himmelreich, Vice President, Head of Sustainability, Occupational Safety and Health, and Dangerous Goods, GEODIS in Americas. ""By investing in renewable energy at our facilities, we are advancing both our corporate climate goals and those of our customers."" Located in one of Mexico's most prominent industrial zones, the rooftop solar project is a strategic step toward reducing GEODIS' greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, increasing low-carbon energy and low-carbon energy use, and enhancing energy resilience at the site level. This initiative supports GEODIS' ambitious climate goals, which were validated by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), that include a 42% reduction in GHG emissions from GEODIS' fleets and buildings (Scope 1+2) and 25% reduction in the carbon intensity of subcontracted transport regarding container shipping, road and rail operations (Scope 3) compared to 2022. A solar installation directly supports GEODIS' targets by reducing Scope 2 emissions (emissions from purchased electricity), assisting with sustainable building certifications and decreasing operational GHG emissions in a scalable way. The project also supports Prologis' goal to deploy 1 gigawatt (GW) of solar, supported by battery storage, across its global real estate portfolio by 2025. ""Low-carbon, reliable energy is a critical resource for our customers,"" said John Hoekstra, Head of Enterprise Sustainability and Europe and LATAM Energy, Prologis. ""As a leader in low-carbon energy generation, we're proud to collaborate with GEODIS to support sustainable logistics operations in Mexico and beyond.""Strategic Fit and Long-Term VisionThis project is the latest example of GEODIS and Prologis' ongoing collaboration. The two companies have worked together on several sustainability initiatives in North America, focusing on energy efficiency, renewable energy integration and workforce development, to reinforce their commitments to environmental stewardship and community engagement. So far in 2025, GEODIS and Prologis have completed three warehouse solar installations, with five additional planned for the remainder of the year. GEODIS' work with Prologis supports its broader sustainability strategy, which includes transitioning to sustainably certified warehouses (e.g., BREEAM and LEED), upgrading energy efficiency across its network and delivering lower-carbon lanes for sustainability-focused customers.In a market where electricity costs and reliability are concerns, the installation will help stabilize energy costs and mitigate exposure to utility rate hikes. The system is designed with future scalability in mind, offering potential for battery storage and microgrid integration.Leading the Way in Sustainable LogisticsAs a global logistics company serving customers across a wide array of verticals—including retail, tech, pharma and automotive—that prioritize sustainability, GEODIS is delivering actionable, measurable solutions that reinforce trust, transparency and environmental leadership.""This solar project is a tangible expression of our commitment to sustainability, innovation and leadership in the logistics sector,"" said Himmelreich. ""It also marks a significant step toward achieving our 2027 Ambition strategic plan and sustainability goals, reflecting our dedication to reducing our environmental footprint and promoting renewable energy solutions. By harnessing solar power, we are reinforcing our role as a responsible and forward-thinking industry leader.""ABOUT GEODISGEODIS is a leading global logistics provider acknowledged for its expertise across all aspects of the supply chain.

This marks the first production-grade deployment of fully automated multi-temperature pallet handling in the industry. While automation has transformed much of logistics, cold storage facilities have lagged behind due to extreme conditions and technical barriers. Geekplus' SkyCube system changes that with frost-resistant engineering and a coordinated fleet of high-density pallet storage robots operating at -18°C, P800 robots in chilled zones (0–5°C), high-speed lifts, and a unified software platform built for continuous operation in sub-zero environments. ""Cold chain logistics is no longer the exception to automation. It's the next frontier,"" said Liu Kai, Head of System at Geekplus. ""Our systems are built to perform where other systems fail. With our multi-temp-compatible robotics, we're redefining how food, pharma, and grocery warehouses scale reliably and efficiently.""JJCL, with seven subsidiary branches and 11 cold storage facilities totaling over 560,000 m³ (approximately 20 million cubic feet), partnered with Geekplus to modernize operations and meet growing demand. Since deployment, the system has increased storage capacity by 70 percent, improved picking efficiency by 90 percent, and achieved 99.99 percent accuracy. It has also enhanced safety by minimizing human exposure to extreme sub-zero temperatures through full automation of cold zone handling. ""As global demand for cold chain services accelerates, the launch provides a scalable blueprint for 3PLs, food distributors, and pharma companies navigating compliance, labor challenges, and operational risk,"" Liu added.

When meeting with his Colombian counterpart Gustavo Petro, Xi said China and Colombia should take the latter's formal accession to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as an opportunity to upgrade bilateral cooperation, according to the Xinhua News Agency. After their meeting, the two heads of state witnessed the signing of a cooperation plan between the two governments on jointly building the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road. Noting Colombia's significance in Latin America, Xi said China has always regarded its relations with the country from a strategic and long-term perspective. ""This year marks the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Colombia. Standing at a new historical starting point, China is willing to make joint efforts with Colombia to advance our strategic partnership and bring more benefits to the two peoples,"" Xi said, per Xinhua. The successful holding of the fourth ministerial meeting of the China-CELAC Forum has sent a positive signal to the world for seeking shared development and revitalization, Xi said, hailing the contribution of Colombia to the meeting as the CELAC rotating chair. China is willing to work with Colombia and other LAC countries to continuously promote the building of a community with a shared future, Xi said. Petro said Colombia looks forward to further boosting ties with China, and that both sides should deepen political mutual trust and enhance mutual support. He called on both sides to work on the BRI, expand cooperation in areas such as trade, infrastructure, new energy and AI, and improve people's lives, according to Xinhua. Noting that the international situation is complex and volatile, Petro said the practices adopted by some countries to pursue unilateral gains are not conducive to the world, and all countries should stand together to respond. Noting that this year marks the 55th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Chile, Xi told Chilean leader Boric that the two countries should constantly enrich the connotation of their comprehensive strategic partnership, create a model of common development between China and Latin American countries, set a stellar example of South-South cooperation, and jointly promote the cause of peace and progress for humanity, per Xinhua. Xi said China is willing to work with Chile to consolidate political mutual trust, enhance exchanges of experience in governance, firmly support each other on issues concerning their core interests and major concerns, and safeguard each other's sovereignty, security and development interests. Xi called on the two countries to implement the Belt and Road cooperation plan, deepen cooperation on agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fisheries, industrial investment, infrastructure and green minerals, and cultivate new growth points in astronomy, polar regions, artificial intelligence, biomedicine and the digital economy. Noting that China has become Chile's most important trading partner, Boric said that bilateral cooperation has benefited the two peoples, according to Xinhua. He said Chile will firmly adhere to the one-China principle, and that it is ready to expand cooperation with China on trade, investment and artificial intelligence, jointly advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, and strengthen people-to-people and cultural exchanges. On Tuesday, Xi also held talks with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in Beijing. At the Great Hall of the People, Xi and Lula witnessed the signing of 20 cooperation documents covering the fields of development strategy alignment, science and technology, agriculture, digital economy, finance, inspection and quarantine, and media. The fourth ministerial meeting of the China-CELAC Forum was held in Beijing on Tuesday. The meeting adopted the Beijing declaration and the China-CELAC joint action plan for cooperation in key areas (2025-2027). Diversified cooperation At the press conference on Wednesday, Lula said that the Beijing Declaration is an inspiration for developing countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Beijing Declaration brings hope. It shows that economically strong countries like China are thinking about how to contribute to the development of the poorest countries, Lula said. Posting a video of the signing of cooperation plan on BRI on social media platform X on Wednesday, Petro wrote that ""the history of our foreign relations is changing."" ""From now on, Colombia will interact with the entire world on a footing of equality and freedom,"" he wrote. Deepened cooperation between China and CELAC members at the forum sends an important signal to countries in the Global South that their collaboration can obtain opportunities for diversified development through the Chinese market, Yin Zhiguang, a professor in international politics at Fudan University, told the Global Times. Equal partnership China does not demand reforms, nor cuts to rights, nor privatizations in exchange for investments, but only advocates cooperation and partnership. That is why the Beijing Declaration could be the new milestone in the economic and diplomatic orientation of Latin America in the 21st century, wrote Leonardo Attuch, founder and CEO of Brasil 247, a Brazilian news and political analysis website. The forum reflects China's consistent support for the cause of the Global South, which is to promote an international order that is more equal, just and free from the dominance and interference of major powers, said Yin, pointing out that the slew of outcome documents indicate that great power politics is not the only option - multilateral cooperation, consultation, and mutual assistance is also a model of global governance.
